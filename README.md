ESP8266 Halloween costume
=========================


This repository contains the code I used to make a IoT Halloween costume
with the ESP8266 controlling some LED "strips" on a skeleton costume.

There is a small web-server (that is a working in progress) with some async features so it is possible to control everything using a normal web browser.
